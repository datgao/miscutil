- ksm.sh, madvmerge.sh, libmadvmerge.so
Hook memory allocation library calls to mark identical user memory pages
as mergeable, toggle kernel same page merging state, and check stats.

- nocache.sh, libnocache.so

Turn off backlight without screensaver.

- snooze.sh and helper snoozer.sh
Lock session and suspend.  On resume, wait for user to unlock, and sleep
again on timeout.

- throttle_cpu.sh
Compromise across CPU performance/power/thermal targets.
1. Performance: ondemand, online, turbo boost, active - snappy
2. Battery: powersave, online, no turbo boost, active - tolerable
3. Fan: powersave, offline, no turbo boost, limit load - beyond slow

- toggle_backlight.sh
Switch bright/dim display.

- zramoff.sh
Empty zram swap and restart zram-config service.
