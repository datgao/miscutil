- Build
Run make to build any or all of the components.  (There is no install target.)
32-bit sub-architecture and cross compiles are supported.

- asm
Heavily inspired by work of Christopher Domas presented at DEFCON 25.  This tool
observes instruction lengths and can search breadth-first or depth-first.  It
displays fault reason and address with e.g. likely stack access or jump taken.
The code configures an alternate signal stack and memory maps the physical page
that holds the instruction to separate virtual RX and RW pages.  Runs about 30 %
faster if Linux boots with 'nopti' option.  (Logic that crudely filters out FS
register usage exists to prevent fatal segfaults during signal handling.  As a
wild guess, this might be related to thread-local storage and alternate stack
access i.e. may crash trying to find the appropriate thread's alternate stack.)

- fat32
Prepend FAT32 metadata before EXT4 partition (or other FS) to ease compatibility
between platforms without copying file data.  It creates a FAT32 FS that
overlaps with the source FS and map files specified from standard input.  This
usually requires at least 0.1 % space reserved before the source partition.  The
source FS is not converted irreversibly and attempts are made to prevent writing
to the FAT32 alias.  Use this tool if you do not value your data and really want
to lose all of it on the first run.  :)

- asp2txt.awk
Convert IR readings from one text-based format to another, optionally convert
units, and write average to standard output from input set e.g. same sample.

- stdansi
Run a program with stdansi to highlight its standard error stream, inspired by
https://github.com/charliesome/errexec

- resparse
Free zeroed blocks in files with resparse.

- dbz
Discard a block device with dbz and check if it will returns zeroes.
This improves imaging speed especially when zeroed blocks can be skipped, as on
many SD cards and eMMC modules.
	devname="mmcblkX"
	devpath="/dev/$devname"
	sysgran="/sys/block/$devname/queue/discard_granularity"
	bsz=0
	[[ -r "$sysgran" ]] && bsz="`< "$sysgran"`"
	[[ "$bsz" -lt 1048576 ]] && bsz=4194304
	./dbz -d "$devpath"
	./dbz -q && z=1
	pv -ptrabfeWB "$bsz" /path/to/disk.img | \
	dd iflag=fullblock bs="$bsz" ${z:+"conv=sparse"} oflag=direct of="$devpath"

- ksm.sh, madvmerge.sh, libmadvmerge.so
Hook memory allocation library calls to mark identical user memory pages
as mergeable, toggle kernel same page merging state, and check stats.

- nocache.sh, libnocache.so
Avoid caching file content in memory.
Both libmadvmerge.so and libnocache.so are based on
https://www.flamingspork.com/projects/libeatmydata/

- sudoers
Grant root permissions without password for snoozer.sh, throttle_cpu.sh,
and toggle_backlight.sh.

- blank_display.sh
Turn off backlight without screensaver.

- snooze.sh and helper snoozer.sh
Lock session and suspend.  On resume, wait for user to unlock, and sleep
again on timeout.

- throttle_cpu.sh
Compromise across CPU performance/power/thermal targets.
1. Performance: ondemand, online, turbo boost, active - snappy
2. Battery: powersave, online, no turbo boost, active - tolerable
3. Fan: powersave, offline, no turbo boost, limit load - beyond slow

- toggle_backlight.sh
Switch bright/dim display.

- zramoff.sh
Empty zram swap and restart zram-config service.
