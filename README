Run make to build any or all of the components.  (There is no install target.)
32-bit sub-architecture and cross compiles are supported.

Run a program with stdansi to highlight its standard error stream.

Free zeroed blocks in files with resparse.

Discard a block device with dbz and check if it will returns zeroes.
This improves imaging speed especially when zeroed blocks can be skipped.
